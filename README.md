# Economic Policy Impact Simulation

This repository contains a MATLAB simulation that models the effects of policy changes‚Äîspecifically increases in income tax and tariffs‚Äîon the following economic indicators:

- Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
- GDP per Capita
- Wealth Concentration (Top 10%)

## üìä Overview

The simulation uses elasticity parameters to estimate the impact of policy shifts and visualizes:

- Change in GDP
- Change in GDP Per Capita
- Change in Wealth Disparity

## üß† Model Parameters

- **GDP (current)**: \$27.36 trillion  
- **Population**: 334.9 million  
- **Wealth Share (Top 10%)**: 60%  
- **Elasticities**:
  - Consumption: 0.6817
  - Investment: 0.207
  - Government Spending: 0.207
  - Wealth Elasticity: 0.5

- **Policy Shift Inputs**:
  - Tax Rate Increase: 22%
  - Tariff Increase: 75%

## üìÅ Files

- `policy_model.m`: Main MATLAB script
- `GDP_change.png`: Plot of GDP change with policy shift
- `GDP_per_capita.png`: Plot of GDP per capita with policy shift
- `Wealth_disparity.png`: Plot of change in wealth concentration

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1. Open `policy_model.m` in MATLAB.
2. Run the script to generate and save plots in PNG format.
3. View graphs in the project folder.
